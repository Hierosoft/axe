XML Editor
==========

At some point I got the idea that the only proper way to edit an xml file
is in a tree based orientation where element and attribute names
are clearly separated from their contents.

From using it I found out that this idea actually works...

I'm currently working on adding a simple dtd editor but mostly I'm trying to add
features that allow me to work fast, like keyboard-shortcuts for common actions
and not adding things I don't need.
